This is version 3 of the "music history" exercise.
It is part of the Single Page App curriculum.
Updates from previous versions of Music History include
adding event listeners to the navigation buttons and
adding functionality to the "Add Music" option.

The elements displayed on the page are controlled by
adding or removing the class "nodisplay" from the divs
representing the "pages."
